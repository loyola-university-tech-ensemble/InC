# Instructions

## The basic premise:
_In C_ (1964), by Terry Riley, is meant for any number of musicians and for any instrumentation. It is a series of 53 short musical patterns to be played by the entire ensemble in order, but asynchronously. An ostinato pulse is usually given by one instrument to keep time (typically a piano, playing the note 'C' in multiple octaves).

At the start, players begin with pattern 1, repeating, looping, or laying out and listening, _ad lib._ Players move on to the next phrase (in order) when they feel that the moment is right. Players should stay within 3 or 4 phrases of the rest of the group. This process continues until the ensemble has played through all 53 patterns.

A complete performance of 'In C' takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half.

This is a **"play-along"** version of Terry Rileys "In C" (1964) designed for inclusion. If you have a device that can play sound through a web browser, you can participate, regardless of musical background or ability.

## To get started

Open the **"Sync"** menu. Someone in the group should designate their device as the **"conductor"** and tap **"Click"** or **"Ostinato"** to hear a steady pulse (this will start the Transport). 

The designated conductor may also use the [conductor](/conductor/) app. This app needs more screen space because of the drum pattern sequencer, so we do not recommend using this on mobile phones (800px width or better recommended). Besides the ostinato (with volume control), the conductor also can be used to project directions for the group.

When another **"player"** starts their Click (or plays a pattern), the pulse will likely be out of sync with the "conductor" pulse. To **synchronize**  metronomes between players and the conductor, pull the **"phase sync"** slider to the right or left. This will temporarily run the player's metronome up to 10% faster or slower. 

**Listen** carefully for when the player's metronome catches up with the conductor's metronome. At that point, the two metronomes should be in sync. Let go of the slider to return to the standard tempo (138 bpm).

Leave the "Transport" running so you can play the rest of the piece. You may turn off the Metronome pulse if you like (recommended except for the "conductor"). Close the Sync tab.

## Player controls
- **Play:** tap on the green trianglular **"play" button** for a given pattern
- **Loop [L]:** start the pattern repeating until the button is tapped again
- **Eigth-note shift [+8n]:** shift the onset of the pattern by one eigth note (syncopation)
- **Rhythmic Augmentation [A]:** double the duration of the pattern
- **Octave shift** ([up] and [down] arrows): shift the pattern +/- 3 octaves 

## Listen and have fun
Everyone begins on pattern #1, playing single passes, or looping (or laying out) as the spirit moves them. When you feel it's right, move on to phrase 2. 

One of the rules of "In C" is that all members of the group should stay within 3-4 phrases of each other. Listen for the others, and don't get too far ahead. See if you can create a "dialog" with someone near you by trading phrases back and forth (maybe in different octaves). Don't forget to turn off loops for phrases you have left behind. Gradually move your way through all 53 phrases with the group, but make your own decisions about whether to play or not, loop or not, raise or lower the octave, and preceisely when to move on the the next phrase.

Nothing is stopping you from moving backwards, but the idea is to move forwards only, and to concentrate on one phrase at a time per player (even though this app allows you to run multiple simultaneous loops). The piece is done when all players have made it to the end, and everyone drops out one by one. Look for a cue from the "conductor" to know when it's really finished. Then give each other a high-five!
